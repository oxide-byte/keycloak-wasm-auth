# Keycloak WASM Auth

## Motivation

Currently there are a couple of libraries already existing on the crates.io. One of them https://crates.io/crates/leptos-keycloak-auth/0.3.1 also took my attention and will most probably be my choice for a SSR application.

And this was one of my first motivations. I apply Leptos currently in CSR and generated a special Use Case to communicate in GraphQL (https://github.com/oxide-byte/rust-berlin-leptos). And for doing my tasks, I had started to build this module and extracted it now here.

## There will be more soon...
